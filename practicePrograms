#how to use input
name = input("What is your name : ")
age = input("What is your age : ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! and You are {age} years old!")

#To add two numbers that are entered by the user

x = input("Enter number one:")
y = input("Enter number Two:")
print(x+y)

x = int(input("Enter number one:"))
y = int(input("Enter number Two:"))
print(x+y)

x = int(input("Enter number one:"))
y = int(input("Enter number Two:"))
result = x + y
print(f"Addition of two number is : {result}")


#String
str = "HelloRohit!!"
print(str)
print(str[1])
print(str[3:5])
print(str[4:])

# Define a list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Indexing: Access the element at index 2
print(numbers[2])  # Output: 30

# Slicing: Extract a sublist from index 1 to index 3
print(numbers[1:3])  # Output: [20, 30]

# Adding elements: Append the number 60 to the list
numbers.append(60)
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

# Removing elements: Remove the element at index 2
del numbers[2]
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 40, 50, 60]

# Modifying elements: Change the value of the element at index 3
numbers[3] = 45
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 40, 45, 60]

# Sorting: Sort the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 40, 45, 60]

# Reversing: Reverse the order of the elements in the list
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)  # Output: [60, 45, 40, 20, 10]

# Counting: Count the number of occurrences of the number 20 in the list
print(numbers.count(20))  # Output: 1

# Finding: Find the index of the number 45 in the list
print(numbers.index(45))  # Output: 1



# Define a tuple
numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Indexing: Access the element at index 2
print(numbers[2])  # Output: 30

# Slicing: Extract a sublist from index 1 to index 3
print(numbers[1:3])  # Output: (20, 30)

# Counting: Count the number of occurrences of the number 20 in the tuple
print(numbers.count(20))  # Output: 1

# Create a new tuple based on the original tuple
new_numbers = numbers[1:]
print(new_numbers)  # Output: (20, 30, 40, 50)
